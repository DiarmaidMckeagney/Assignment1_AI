# Style Guide for Project

This is a styleguide for the project to ensure consistency 
in how we write the code and organise the project. This is necessary for me (Diarmaid)
because I am bad at maintaining consistent naming schemes for anything.

### File Naming Scheme
Files should be named in Pascal case. For example, this file is called StyleGuide. If 
the file has only a single word in the name it should still be capitalised.

### Variable Naming Scheme
Variables should be named in Camel case. For example, thisVar. Constants should be entirely uppercase-snakecase. For example, a constant containing population count would be called something like POP_COUNT.

### Function Naming Scheme
Functions should be named in snake case. For example a function name would be something like: func.
